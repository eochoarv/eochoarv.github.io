title: "[Manhattan Project Visualization](https://salty-lowlands-43283.herokuapp.com/)"
excerpt: "Visualization of the involvement of people from Princeton University in the Manhattan Project. All moving
dots (after settling in their final locations) are interactive: clicking them will give a short audio clip of the
person's involvement in their final location. Note: rendering is pretty compute-intensive, so it may be choppy before
settling down.
