excerpt: "Branch prediction has become an essential part of the CPU pipeline. This work explored using a perceptron for doing branch prediction in the Gem5 x86 CPU simulator. LTAGE and existing branch predictors were found to generally have better performance overall, albeit with slightly less accuracy in prediction in some cases tested on, than a perceptron.
