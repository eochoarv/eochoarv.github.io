excerpt: 'Given the extent to which machine learning algorithms have come to characterize lives, both on a daily and longscale basis, the study of their ingrained biases is much in order. Many tools have emerged to understand such biases, both those that explicitly look at the underlying classifier code (white-box) and those that are agnostic thereof (black-box). White-box tools can provide greater insight, but are typically limited in the types of models they can analyze. A new tool, FairSquare, provides a method of applying white-box techniques to more complex models. However, since FairSquare requires a new classifier syntax and knowledge of an underlying population model, there was much left to be desired as an end-user. We present a tool, FairTear, which provides a clean UI through which end users can feed in their classifier and view its analysis result from the FairSquare tool. Our tool automates both the process of generating the population model and the process of converting a classifier to the FairSquare syntax. In turn, the user is fully abstracted from the FairSquare back-end, allowing them to determine the fairness of his algorithm without any additional knowledge than what is contained in their code. FairTear is capable of making use of nearly all the supported FairSquare functionality, supporting multi-level conditioning of population model features and different feature distributions (Gaussian and multi-step uniform). FairTear also integrates with the popular scikit-learn Python machine learning package, supporting several of its classifiers (decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks) in addition to additional preprocessing steps (StandardScaler). In doing so, we hope to allow a variety of endusers, from academia and industry alike, to take advantage of our system in real-world machine learning pipelines. Tests revealed full automation on all ends (i.e. supporting each of the classifiers referenced above), with fairness results being displayed on the front-end and an appropriate classifier decomposition visible on the back-end. In line with that, we considered further extensions to both our tool and FairSquare. These largely revolve around supporting a greater extent of the sklearn library, including additional distributions, preprocessing features, and classifiers.'
