excerpt: 'Tesla and electrical vehicles (EVs) have become more prevalent in the last decade. With the great rise in projected growth in EVs, the issue of placing electrical charging stations has grown to the forefronts of customers’ and business owners’ minds alike. We seek to address this problem, namely by investigating policies to determine the optimal locations to place electrical charging stations in a city setting. For this task, we developed a lookup-table model, with altered updating equations, and tested a few learning policies, in the forms of online and offline Knowledge Gradient Exploration (KG), Interval Estimation (IE), Boltzmann Exploration, and Pure Exploitation. Upon doing so, we found that the Knowledge Gradient Policy was the most effective in maximizing our total usage over all stations within our time horizon. We therefore, recommend it as a baseline for building future policies in this context of maximizing station utilization. Future studies may wish to expand upon the bottleneck employed in the model for charging stations and also time inhomogeneity'
