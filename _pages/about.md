I'm a computer vision/graphics engineer at Facebook. I graduated as a math major from Princeton in 2018 (certificates in
CS and Statistics/ML). I'm also extremely interested in exploring the theoretical underpinnings of modern deep learning
systems, potentially exploring how that ties into pre-existing statistical learning theory. Some highlights of projects I have
worked on (see other tabs for full lists):
