I'm a computer vision/graphics engineer at Facebook, where I'm working on doing realtime dense 3D reconstruction for dynamic scenes (a la KinectFusion
and corresponding dynamic extensions). I previously worked on the software for the [Manifold camera](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/An-Integrated-6DoF-Video-Camera-and-System-Design.pdf),
specifically adding support for rendering on cloud farms and improving the efficiency of the depth estimation algorithm), and also created, optimized (with
layer fusion and int8 quantization using QAT), an end-to-end deep learning-based feature for Portal that runs at realtime on the Snapdragon SoC.

I graduated as a Math major from Princeton in 2018 (certificates in CS and Statistics/ML). I'm now extremely interested in exploring the theoretical 
underpinnings of modern deep learning systems, potentially exploring how that ties into pre-existing statistical learning theory. I also really enjoy reading
[books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83094203-yash-patel) and [papers](https://github.com/yashpatel5400/cool-papers). 

See my full resume [here](http://yashpatel5400.github.io/files/resume.pdf). Some projects I have worked on (see other tabs for full lists):

Research:
- [FairTear]()
- [Deanonymization of Bitcoin Transactions]()

Projects:
