I'm currently a computer vision/graphics engineer at Facebook, where I'm working on doing realtime dense 3D reconstruction (Ã  la point clouds/KinectFusion). I previously worked on the software for the [Manifold camera](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/An-Integrated-6DoF-Video-Camera-and-System-Design.pdf), specifically adding support for rendering on cloud farms and improving the efficiency of the depth estimation algorithm. I also implemented, trained, and optimized (with layer fusion, SNPE, and QAT quantization) an end-to-end deep learning-based feature for Portal to run at realtime on the Snapdragon SoC.

I graduated as a Math major from Princeton in 2018 (certificates in CS and Statistics/ML). I'm now extremely interested in exploring the theoretical 
underpinnings of modern deep learning systems and building out statistical tools, particularly those that can be applied to biomedical problems. I also really enjoy reading [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83094203-yash-patel) and [papers](https://github.com/yashpatel5400/cool-papers).
