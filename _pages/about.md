I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in the statistics department at the University of Michigan, where I am advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/). 

I previously worked as Senior Analyst at [BBVA Mexico] (https://www.bbva.mx/personas/productos/patrimonial-y-privada/inversiones/notas-estructuradas.html), where I worked on developing structured investment products using fixed income financial derivatives.

I graduated from the Actuarial Science major at [UNAM](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/) in 2016.

Research Interest
======

I am broadly interested in theory and application of Machine Learning. Particularly, I am interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In past, I have also worked with Hidden Markov models.

Projects
======

- Last summer, I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Edward Ionides](https://ionides.github.io/), [Mercedes Pascual](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/faculty/mercedes-pascual-phd) and Rahul Subramanian analyzing data from an outbreak of dengue in Rio de Janeiro during 2012 and 2013. We applied particle filter approaches to fit and make inference for the models developed by Rahul Subramanian. [Dengue in Rio](https://github.com/eochoarv/Rio_State_SpatPomp_Inference).
- Currently, I am part of the project Measuring, Modeling, and Mapping Microplastics in the Atmosphere of Michigan [M4AM](https://github.com/eochoarv/Rio_State_SpatPomp_Inference).
